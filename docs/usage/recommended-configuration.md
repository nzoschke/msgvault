title: Recommended Configuration
description: Set up optional search and people features from your available provider keys, then check what still needs attention.
---

Use `msgvault setup providers` to configure optional search and people features
from the provider keys you already have. It proposes defaults, explains what
each provider will receive, and asks for consent before saving. Keyword search
and normal archive browsing do not need provider keys.

A **lane** in setup's output is one optional feature: message embeddings,
semantic people search, visual attachments, document extraction, document
vectors, or people sweeps. Each has its own readiness and consent checks.

```bash
export VOYAGE_API_KEY="..."      # text, people, and visual search
export MISTRAL_API_KEY="..."     # document attachments
export OPENAI_API_KEY="..."      # people sweep (and text search when no Voyage key)

msgvault setup providers --dry-run   # show the plan and each provider disclosure
msgvault setup providers             # answer once per provider, write config.toml
msgvault setup providers --allow-sensitive # opt into sensitive evidence for the people sweep
msgvault setup status                # what is on, what is off, and why
```

Setup prints follow-up commands for features that still need a capability probe,
consent, or index build. `setup status` checks those prerequisites and shows the
next step. Its provider confirmations do not replace those separate consents. A
key by itself never starts hosted processing.

## Use an authenticated embedding proxy

A service launcher can supply an Authorization header and its permitted endpoint
through environment variables, without saving a provider API key in the archive:

```bash
export MSGVAULT_PROXY_AUTHORIZATION="Basic ..."
export MSGVAULT_PROXY_ENDPOINT="https://proxy.example.test/llm/v1"
msgvault setup proxy --endpoint "$MSGVAULT_PROXY_ENDPOINT" \
  --authorization-env MSGVAULT_PROXY_AUTHORIZATION \
  --authorization-endpoint-env MSGVAULT_PROXY_ENDPOINT
```

This fills missing settings for `text-embedding-3-small` with 1536 dimensions,
a one-minute indexing schedule, and indexing after sync. Semantic search stays
off by default. Existing settings, including the enable switch, are preserved.
Enable **Semantic search** in the web app's Search settings and save. The daemon
must restart to apply the change; service managers can watch `config.toml` to
automate that restart. Disabling the switch stops indexing and semantic queries
after the restart and preserves the existing vectors.

The launcher must pass both environment variables to the daemon. Requests fail
before sending data if the credential is missing or the endpoint does not match.
Provider redirects are rejected. This setup does not enable people sweeps,
person embeddings, document vectors, or visual search.

## What starts without provider setup

A fresh archive supports keyword search, browsing, saved people, and local
contact history without a provider. The daemon refreshes contact activity
hourly. Chat imports collect media by default, subject to the room and file size
limits below. Sources still need their own authorization and sync setup.

Message embeddings, semantic people search, visual search, document extraction,
document vectors, people sweeps, and external enrichment are off. Setup enables
the eligible features described below; it does not configure external
enrichment, authorize a source, choose people to track, or enroll anyone in
conversation briefs.

| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

Other messages share the generation as individual documents.                                                        |
| `MISTRAL_API_KEY`                       | document extraction and lexical search; document vectors when a text lane is on | `mistral-ocr-4-0`, EU region                                                        | Uploads are manual-only and need the probe manifest plus `documents consent-mistral --yes`.                                                                                            |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`                        | people sweep with `--allow-sensitive`; text search only when no Voyage key      | `gpt-5.6-luna` at `medium` reasoning; `text-embedding-3-small` (1536)               | The OpenAI text path gives per-message vectors: no conversation-window context and no visual lane, both are Voyage-only endpoints.                                                     |
| no key for the feature being configured | loopback Ollama at `[chat].server` when reachable                               | `nomic-embed-text` (768); the `[chat].model` for the sweep with `--allow-sensitive` | Text uses Ollama only without Voyage or OpenAI keys. Inference uses it without an OpenAI key, even when Voyage or Mistral is configured. The required model must already be installed. |

These are setup choices, not runtime failover. Adding a Voyage key does not
replace an existing OpenAI text index, and an unavailable inference provider
does not cause a sweep to switch providers. Setup does not use a signed-in Codex
account: the
[Codex app-server transport](../configuration.md#codex-app-server-profiles)
remains release-gated. Configure another supported inference profile explicitly
when the selected API or local model is not the one you want.

## The file setup writes

With a Voyage key, a Mistral key, and an OpenAI key present and
`--allow-sensitive` supplied, successful setup produces the configuration below.
The example assumes SQLite, no probe manifests yet, and a people-provider check
that negotiates native JSON output. The saved output mode and token-limit field
come from that check. Comments and sections you already have are preserved.

```toml
[vector]
enabled = true
backend = "sqlite-vec"          # "pgvector" when [data].database_url is PostgreSQL

[vector.embeddings]
api_format = "voyage-contextual" # conversation windows and turn-aware meeting chunks
endpoint = "https://api.voyageai.com/v1"
api_key_env = "VOYAGE_API_KEY"
model = "voyage-context-4"
dimension = 1024

[vector.embed.schedule]
run_after_sync = true            # embed after supported scheduled source syncs
cron = "*/15 * * * *"            # and catch up chat sources that do not trigger a post-sync pass

[vector.people]
enabled = true                   # one curated, non-sensitive document per person
retention_posture = "provider-declared"
training_posture = "provider-declared"

[vector.multimodal.schedule]
run_after_sync = true
cron = "*/15 * * * *"
# [vector.multimodal] enabled = true and capabilities_file are written once the
# probe manifest exists at <home>/voyage-capabilities.json.

[attachments.documents]
enabled = true
retention_posture = "standard"   # or "zdr"; --document-retention
training_posture = "default-opt-out" # or "opted-out"; --document-training

[attachments.documents.index.embeddings]
enabled = true                   # document chunks use the text-search profile after `documents vectors consent`

[people.sweep]
enabled = true
provider = "openai"

[people.sweep.providers.openai]
protocol = "openai_chat"
endpoint = "https://api.openai.com/v1"
model = "gpt-5.6-luna"
auth = "bearer"
credential = "env"
credential_env = "OPENAI_API_KEY"
output_mode = "native_json_schema"
token_limit_parameter = "max_completion_tokens"
reasoning_effort = "medium"
retention_posture = "provider-declared"
training_posture = "provider-declared"
allowed_sources = ["conversation_text", "meeting_text", "document_text"]
source_since = "2025-01-01"      # January 1 of last year
allow_sensitive = true
request_timeout = "1m0s"
```

### `[vector]` and `[vector.embeddings]`

The text lane. `api_format = "voyage-contextual"` pins `voyage-context-4` and
sends each Beeper conversation window and each meeting as one contextual
request, so a message is embedded with its neighbors. Other chat sources and
email remain individual documents. The OpenAI-compatible format
(`api_format = "openai"`) embeds each message on its own. Hosted configurations
send message text to that provider; a loopback Ollama endpoint processes it
locally. Setup states the destination before asking.

The recommended text scope includes all message types and accounts. Narrow
[`[vector.embed.scope]`](../configuration.md#vectorembedscope) before starting
the daemon if only part of the archive should reach the embedding provider. Text
embeddings have no separate stored consent: after setup enables the schedule,
the daemon can send eligible text when it loads the new settings.

`run_after_sync` covers Gmail, IMAP, Teams, and Discord syncs. The cron covers
Slack, Beeper, calendar, and meeting sources, which do not trigger a post-sync
embed. See [Vector Search](/docs/usage/vector-search/).

### `[vector.people]`

Semantic people search embeds one curated document per durable person
(searchable, non-sensitive attributes only) into the same generation, so a query
like "a finance contact in Berlin" returns the person. The postures are your
assertion about the embedding provider; setup records `provider-declared` unless
you pass `--retention-posture` and `--training-posture`. Consent is a separate
step: `msgvault person provider consent --semantic-embeddings --yes`. See
[semantic person search](/docs/usage/people/#find-a-person-by-what-you-remember)
for the build and search workflow.

### `[vector.multimodal]`

The visual lane needs a capability manifest from an authenticated probe of
Voyage with private synthetic fixtures, and the probe needs four seed files you
supply (a WebP and an MP4, each with a contrasting variant). Enabling the lane
without the manifest makes the daemon refuse every vector lane, so setup writes
only the schedule until the manifest exists:

```bash
msgvault multimodal probe --seeds <private-seed-dir> --out ~/.msgvault/voyage-capabilities.json --yes
msgvault setup providers        # now enables [vector.multimodal] with that manifest
msgvault daemon restart
msgvault multimodal build --yes # consent to exactly that capability profile
```

### `[attachments.documents]`

Mistral is the document extraction provider. It receives original attachment
bytes for directly authorized formats, or locally converted PDF bytes when CSV
conversion is enabled. Setup records `standard` retention and `default-opt-out`
training unless you pass `--document-retention zdr` or
`--document-training opted-out`; use the values your account actually has.
Uploads stay manual: build the fixture matrix, probe, consent, then build. See
[Document Attachment Indexing](/docs/usage/document-indexing/).

```bash
msgvault documents probe-mistral --fixtures <private-fixture-dir> > ~/.msgvault/mistral-capabilities.json
msgvault documents consent-mistral --capabilities ~/.msgvault/mistral-capabilities.json --yes
msgvault documents build --capabilities ~/.msgvault/mistral-capabilities.json --yes
msgvault documents vectors consent --yes     # when document vectors are enabled
msgvault documents vectors consent --purpose queries --yes
msgvault daemon restart
msgvault documents vectors build
```

Document-vector consent covers document text. Query consent separately permits
sending semantic and hybrid document search query text to the embedding
provider. `setup status` reports `document_embedding` and `query_embedding`
consent separately and lists each missing consent command.

### `[people.sweep]`

The sweep maintains profile facts from archive evidence for people you track
(`msgvault person track <person-id>`). Deterministic contact state (last
contacted, cadence, inferred channel) refreshes hourly for everyone through
`[activity]` and needs no model. Setup onboards the `openai` profile through
`person provider add` (a synthetic check request is sent), records consent, and
selects it. The default sweep schedule is daily at `02:15` in the daemon's time
zone. Setup preserves any saved sweep schedule. `allow_sensitive = true` is
required for real sweeps because every archive evidence packet is marked
sensitive. Setup sets it only when you pass `--allow-sensitive`; without that
flag it leaves the sweep unconfigured. The same flag permits inference of
sensitive attributes; there is no separate setup flag for allowing private
source text while excluding sensitive targets. With no OpenAI key, setup offers
a loopback Ollama profile on `[chat].model`.

Before tracking people, review the selected sources and date range. Setup
includes conversation and meeting text from January 1 of the previous year, plus
document text when the document feature is configured. It keeps the default
request and token budgets and does not add provider prices or monetary caps. See
[sweep budgets](../configuration.md#peoplesweepbudgets) and
[Profile Automation](people-automation.md) to review inferred facts, adjust the
policy, or change a provider.

Briefs require another choice for each person:

```bash
msgvault person brief enroll <person-id> --track
msgvault person brief generate <person-id>
```

Enrollment and tracking serve different purposes. Tracking alone does not enable
a brief; enrollment requires tracking or the explicit `--track` flag. The daily
sweep refreshes eligible briefs, normally once their current version is seven
days old. Manual generation bypasses that interval. Briefs use supported chat
and text-message evidence, not email, meetings, or documents. See
[Conversation Briefs](people-briefs.md) for evidence limits and recovery.

### `[activity]`

On by default (`17 * * * *`). It projects archived messages into dated
per-person contact state; day boundaries use UTC by default. Nothing to
configure; see [Configuration](/docs/configuration/#activity).

### Media policy

Chat sources cap collection by conversation size: media from rooms above 20
participants is skipped with a typed `participant_threshold` marker, direct and
small-group media is kept. Set `media_max_participants = 0` on a source to lift
the cap. The per-file default is 250 MiB for Beeper, Slack, and Teams, and 50
MiB for Discord. These limits also apply to existing configurations that omit
the keys; setup does not need to write them. Explicit values and per-account
overrides keep their configured policy. See
[Media policy](../configuration.md#media-policy).

## What the MCP server answers with these defaults

The daemon-backed MCP server reads saved people and local derived state without
provider calls:

| Reader question                       | Tool and source                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Who is this, and how do I reach them? | `get_person_profile`: curated non-sensitive attributes, current employment, relationships, contact points, preferred channel, and inferred channel. Private Notes and sensitive attributes are excluded.         |
| When did we last talk?                | `get_person_profile`: dated contact state from the activity projection.                                                                                                                                          |
| What did we talk about?               | `get_person_profile`: the current brief under `last_talked.brief`, or `null` when no brief is available. Enrollment and successful generation are required first. Reading the profile does not generate a brief. |
| Who was active recently?              | `list_directory_people`: saved people ordered by latest contact by default, with date filters and pagination. Observed contacts without a saved person remain in `search_people`.                                |

Optional retrieval tools include `semantic_search_messages`,
`find_similar_messages`, `search_visual_attachments`, and
`search_document_attachments`. Their queries need the corresponding configured
feature, consent, and usable index. Setup's final MCP summary is a partial list
derived from configuration flags; it is not the server's live tool catalog or an
index-readiness check. See [MCP Server](chat.md) for the full tool contract.

## Existing settings and pending setup

Hosted lanes never turn on from a key alone. Setup asks before it writes,
records the postures you assert, runs the people-provider check and consent
through the same gates the `person provider` commands enforce, and prints the
exact commands that finish the lanes it cannot complete on its own (the two
provider probes need private synthetic seed files). Re-running setup after
adding a key upgrades only the lanes that are still unset; a configured lane
keeps its model, because switching the embedding policy invalidates the index
and is your call.

If visual search is already enabled but `capabilities_file` is unset, setup
validates `<home>/voyage-capabilities.json` and offers to save that path. It
does not replace an explicit custom path. Status stays pending until the path is
saved and the remaining consent and readiness checks pass.

When enabling a disabled lane, setup preserves saved retention and training
postures. Defaults fill only unset values. Pass `--retention-posture` or
`--training-posture` to replace the corresponding people-search posture, or
`--document-retention` or `--document-training` for document extraction. Already
enabled lanes with known postures remain unchanged. `unknown` is unset, not an
assertion: setup fills it with the disclosed default, or the corresponding
explicit flag. This also completes an already-enabled document lane whose
postures are still unknown, under the Mistral confirmation.

Setup also preserves each explicit `cron` and `run_after_sync` setting for text
and visual embeddings, including `cron = ""` and `run_after_sync = false`. Only
absent keys receive schedule defaults. Missing embedding credentials leave text
search and its dependent people-search and document-vector lanes pending in the
status report.

Configured vector lanes also stay pending when the binary lacks the backend
required by the archive database. Status includes the rebuild command.

Consent-gated lanes also remain pending until their required consents are
active, including when the consent records cannot be read. Visual consent must
match both the current configuration and the capability-manifest policy; after
either changes, run `msgvault multimodal build --yes` again. Local Ollama setup
clears any old `api_key_env` setting because its selected loopback endpoint does
not require authentication.

For existing text endpoints, setup recognizes the exact OpenAI and Voyage API
hosts over HTTPS and loopback servers. Other hosted endpoints are custom:
configure their people-search and document-vector lanes explicitly, then review
the separate consent commands for the new data they will receive.

The people sweep stays pending without `--allow-sensitive`, even with `--yes`.
The flag permits sending sensitive archive excerpts to the inference provider
and inferring sensitive personal attributes. The plan describes this policy in
both human and JSON output.

## Reading the status report

`setup status` reads local configuration, the process environment, stored
credentials, and archive consent records. It does not contact a provider. An
`on` state means those setup checks passed; use the index's status command or
[Web Operations](/docs/web-ui/#operations) to inspect build progress and
coverage.

```text
LANE                                      STATE    PROVIDER  MODEL             CONSENT  SCHEDULE
Text search (messages, chats, meetings)   on       voyage    voyage-context-4  -        cron */15 * * * *, after each scheduled sync
Semantic people search                    pending  voyage    voyage-context-4  missing  -
Visual attachment search                  pending  -         -                 -        -
Document attachments (...)                pending  mistral   mistral-ocr-4-0   missing  -
```

`pending` means the lane is configured or the key is present but an operator
step remains; the `next` line under the table names it. `unknown` consent means
the archive could not be read (for example, the database does not exist yet).
Hosted visual, document, and people-sweep lanes also show `pending` when
required credentials are missing. Text and visual search accept stored provider
credentials bound to the configured provider and endpoint, as well as
environment keys. Unreadable credential stores and endpoint mismatches leave
these lanes pending, matching daemon startup. People-sweep status also validates
the active profile's stored credential. A missing, unreadable, or incompatible
key leaves the lane pending with recovery guidance. These checks do not create
credential directories or change permissions; restore the credential or add and
select a replacement profile. Document consent is checked against the full
extraction policy, including limits, normalization, scope, and probe evidence.
Keep the manifest used for consent at `<home>/mistral-capabilities.json` so
setup can verify that exact policy. If it is missing or does not match, status
reports consent as missing and the lane as pending; a consent record for an
older policy is not enough. Use `--json` for scripting.
